### Work :bar_chart:

Using Python, the following questions were answered.

- What is the shape of the dataframe?
- Pick two categorical columns: What data are they storing? How are they distributed?
- What are the peak hours of Total Bookings across different Vehicle Types?
- What are the peak hours of Total Bookings across different Vehicle Types, excluding Completed Rides?
- During peak hours, what are the common Booking Status across different Vehicle Types?
- During peak hours, what are the common reasons for driver and customer cancellations?

### Results :eyes:

The shape of the dataframe is **21 columns** and **150,000 rows** in the Uber data.

#### 1st Categorical Column: Vehicle Type

**Completed** is the most common form of Booking Status in service with Uber.  

####  Hourly Total Bookings by Vehicle Type

The peak hour of the total bookings for the DAY is **10:00 (10 am)**, where **Auto** is the most common Vehicle Type.

The peak hour of the total bookings for the NIGHT is **18:00 (6 pm)**, where **Auto** is the most common Vehicle Type.

#### Hourly Bookings by Vehicle Type excluding Completed Rides
<img width="1073" height="364" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf39f22-f90d-45bb-b021-6a35caf7064a" />

The peak hour of the total bookings excluding Completed Rides for the Day is **10:00 (10 am)**, where **Auto** is the most common Vehicle Type.

The peak hour of the total bookings excluding Completed Rides for the Night is **18:00 (6 pm)**, where **Auto** is the most common Vehicle Type.

#### Booking Status during DAY Peak Hour by Vehicle Type excluding Completed Rides
<img width="853" height="615" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e432d65c-5710-4bba-89fe-53298fc6630f" />

#### Booking Status during NIGHT Peak Hour by Vehicle Type excluding Completed Rides
<img width="880" height="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/296ce807-3b2f-4f2d-8600-9eaa358bae51" />

Across both DAY and NIGHT peak hours, **Cancellation by Driver** was the common Booking Status across all Vehicle Types, excluding Completed Rides.

#### Reason for Booking Cancellations from Customers
<img width="858" height="622" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/401d376f-824d-4af3-8134-14ea4b3d8b53" />


<img width="866" height="625" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbddfb8c-a871-4a96-b013-1a44efdb2fff" />

For the DAY peak, the reasons for cancellation by customers across all Vehicle Types differ significantly. 
- Primary reason for cancellation by Customer for Bike, Sedan, Premier Sedan: **Driver asked to cancel** 
- Primary reason for cancellation by Customer for Auto, Go Mini: **Driver is not moving towards pickup location**
- Primary reason for cancellation by Customer for Uber XL, eBike: **change of plans**

For the NIGHT peak, the reasons for cancellation by customers across all Vehicle Types differ significantly. 
- Primary reason for cancellation by Customer for Auto: **wrong address** and **change of plans**
- Primary reason for cancellation by Customer for Bike: **Driver is not moving towards pickup location** and **wrong address** 
- Primary reason for cancellation by Customer for Go Mini: **wrong address**
- Primary reason for cancellation by Customer for Go Sedan: **AC is not working** and **Driver is not moving towards pickup location**
- Primary reason for cancellation by Customer for Uber XL: **AC is not working** and **wrong address**
- Primary reason for cancellation by Customer for eBike: **Driver asked to cancel**

<img width="861" height="624" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e462987-b4f4-46a6-aa77-9eb98a2a7d06" />

Across both DAY and NIGHT peaks, **Customer related issue** and **More than permitted people in there** were the most common reasons for cancellation by driver across all Vehicle Types.

**Future Considerations**
- Perform statistical analysis to determine the relationship between Vehicle Type and Booking Status.
- Run a linear regression to determine how the independent variables affect the Booking Value.
